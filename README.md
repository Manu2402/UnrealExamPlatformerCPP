# UnrealExamPlatformerCPP
Technical demo about a "platformer like" game developed in Unreal Engine 5 mainly via C++.
## Game description
- The game consists to climb a tower composed by a lot of floors, where every main floors have a quest to complete in order to going up.
- Goes up to the tower  is possible by "Super Mario" pipes, that works as teleports, and in the main floors the pipe that brings you up will be locked while you complete the quest of the current floor.
- For this demo, the only main floor quest is to defeat an enemy (with patrol and chase states).
- There are some checkpoints in the tower that will save the game, and there are three save game slots.
- At the last floor there is a platform, if you are going to press it, i will give you an advice: turn down the volume of your headphones/speakers.
- In order to complete the game, you will take the "Super Mario" flagpole.
- The game starts with a score of 100 and if you getting damage by the enemy the score will decrease. When the score reach 0 you will lose the game.
## Controls
- <b>A</b> -> Left movement
- <b>D</b> -> Right Movement
- <b>Space</b> -> Jump
- <b>P</b> -> Turn to menu (as pause menu).
## Disclaimer
- The purpose of this exam project was to create a technical demo of a platform video game using, ideally, only C++. I am well aware that the correct development methodology is to use both Blueprints and C++, each for what it is best suited for.
- Although the aim was to create a video game using C++, the C++ knowledge required for this project mainly relates to Unreal Engine C++, rather than classic C++. It is therefore normal that the code is not excellent from a low-level optimization point of view and does not fully comply with classic C++ standards.
